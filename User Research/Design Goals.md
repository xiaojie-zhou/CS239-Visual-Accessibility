We identified four key design goals for developing a tool that helps ensure educational materials are accessible to colorblind students. These goals are informed by our research and feedback from our user research.

#### Design Goal 1: Support Knowledge Building

Many TAs are unaware of how colorblind students perceive visual materials (Relevant Factor: Knowledge). To address this, the tool should provide clear explanations of the challenges colorblind students face and offer resources on accessibility best practices. It should also link to external guidelines and tutorials, including code snippets that show how to make figures more accessible in different programming languages.  
Reflections on tools that support knowledge building:  
Existing resources, like WCAG guidelines and color simulators, help raise awareness but don’t always provide practical implementation steps. By integrating knowledge-building features directly into the tool, we can make it easier for instructors to learn and apply accessibility improvements without extra effort.

#### Design Goal 2: Enable Flexibility for Instructors

Different instructors have different ways of preparing their teaching materials, so the tool should be adaptable to various workflows (Relevant Factor: Perceived Control). It should offer both automated suggestions and manual adjustment options, giving instructors the choice to modify figures themselves if they prefer. If an instructor wants to make changes manually—perhaps to preserve high resolution—the tool should provide targeted guidance based on the software or programming language they are using.  
Reflections on tools that support flexible workflows:  
Most existing accessibility tools, like contrast checkers, apply a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not work for all instructors. A tool that adapts its recommendations to different formats and workflows will be more useful and widely adopted.

#### Design Goal 3: Emphasize Accessibility

The primary goal of this tool is to ensure that visual materials are accessible to students with color vision deficiencies (Relevant Factor: Attitude \- Experiential Attitude). It should prioritize accessibility-first design principles and encourage instructors to integrate colorblind-friendly visuals into their teaching materials.  
Reflections on accessibility in visual materials:  
Research shows that inaccessible visuals can significantly impact students’ learning experiences. While some instructors are familiar with general accessibility principles, many don’t realize how color contrast, alternative patterns, and colorblind-friendly palettes affect students. By embedding accessibility checks into the workflow, we can help prevent these issues before they become barriers.

#### Design Goal 4: Ensure Fast Response and Ease of Use

TAs are often busy and may not have time for complicated accessibility checks (Relevant Factor: Habit). The tool should be quick, intuitive, and require minimal effort to use. It should provide clear, actionable suggestions that don’t require extensive training.  
Reflections on usability in accessibility tools:  
Many accessibility tools are effective but require users to have specialized knowledge. By making this tool self-explanatory and integrating it smoothly into existing workflows, we can reduce the effort required from instructors and encourage more widespread use.
