# Core assignment: Pilot + Evaluation Prep [+4.5] Group

Pilot [+1]

[+0.5] Present the pilot user with a brief statement of the scenario and task. Ask the pilot user to complete the task. Note: You might feel (very) nervous that something will break. That is OK. It's ok for the pilot user to break things as they test out your system. Be prepared to restart/recover your system when things break. Note what happened step by step. Include 0.5-1p of notes on one pilot user. Additionally, summarize in a few sentences: What happened? Why? What changes do you need to make to your system before the next pilot?

The pilot testing revealed that users found the UI elegant and straightforward, with all testers agreeing that the results were good. However, several areas for improvement were identified. Key enhancements include ensuring that important information remains easily accessible by adding a disclaimer and info page, increasing spacing between elements for better readability, and implementing hover comments for additional explanations. Additionally, improvements in download separation and better demo figures for colorblindness support were suggested to enhance accessibility. The next steps involve refining these aspects, conducting another pilot experiment to validate the changes, and fully implementing the system based on user feedback.

[+0.5] Involve another pilot user outside the course. Include 0.5-1p of notes on this second pilot user. Summarize in a few sentences: What happened? Why? What changes do you need to make to your system before the next pilot?

Before conducting an evaluation [+3]

1. [+0.5] Articulate1-2 questions motivating the evaluation. In other words, what are the 1-2 things you want to prioritize learning through the evaluation?

2. [+0.5] What metrics will you use to answer the above research questions? Why are these metrics appropriate? What are the benefits and drawbacks of using these metrics?
Requirements: You are required to conduct a mixed-methods study where you collect qualitative and quantitative data. In your response to this question, describe what kind of data (e.g., open-ended survey, interview, time, clicks, etc.) will be useful for answering your motivating questions. 

3. [+1] Specify a plan for recruiting participants.
How will you contact participants (e.g., mailing lists, in-person, etc)?
What are your inclusion/exclusion criteria for participants? 
Will you include participants you interviewed for user research? Why or why not?
Where will you perform the evaluation?
What data will you collect from participants? How will you inform them of this and obtain informed consent?

4. [+1] Write out a step-by-step protocol for conducting each user evaluation. Getting on the same page is important for more easily conducting studies and analyzing data across participants. Your protocol should include: (1) a script of what you will say to each participant; (2) what behaviors/responses you expect from participants and how that may change the flow of the study, if at all; and (3) how you will transition between phases of the study (e.g., from a task to an interview). 
For fun [+0.5]

[+0.5] Name your system!

[+0.5] DEPTH: Design a logo for your system. Include a PNG in your repo. Add it to the README.
