# Local Development 
Open **two** terminals for backend and frontend
## Backend
Assuming python 3.12 is already installed

Use virtual environment
### Installation

```
cd Prototype/backend
python3.12 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running
```
flask --app app run
```
Ideally, the backend should be running on http://localhost:5000 
#### Unless error, skip to the frontend section to run the frontend.

If there is an error, make sure you are using the venv environment by checking python and flask paths:
```
which python
which flask
which pip
```
The output should be the path to the .venv folder. 

If it points to anaconda or system python/flask, you can activate the environment by running:
```
conda deactivate
```
## Frontend
Assuming [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed, also using virtual environment

### Installation
```
cd Prototype/frontend
python3.12 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
npm install
```

### Running
```
npm run dev
```
